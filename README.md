# how-are-you

Angular + Express website for summarizing your emotions into one word

We all know the centuries old question "how are you?" The answer isn't always very simple, and it can feel challenging to express your emotions in a concise way. Because of that, I developed an app that can help me (and hopefully others) have an easier time with answering.

The inspiration behind this was to test the waters with using AI and web development together. Building the app didn't require any actual tinkering with the emotion recognition model, but it was a cool learning experience nonetheless. I'm hoping to start a more complex project after this one that will put more focus on the AI side of things.

Check out Hugging Face and the amazing selection of models that you can use just like I did to build this app!
